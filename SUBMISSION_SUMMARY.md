## ⚖️ Design Trade-offs & Decisions

### 1. **Historical Data Processing Strategy**

**Decision**: Only process 1-second timeframe historically

**Trade-offs**:
```
✅ PROS:
- Fast startup (30-60 seconds vs 1+ hour)
- Immediate usability for demo
- 10,000+ bars available instantly
- Sufficient data for all analytics

❌ CONS:
- 1m timeframe starts with minimal data (accumulates naturally)
- 5m timeframe starts with minimal data (accumulates naturally)
- Historical 1m/5m analytics require waiting

⚖️ RATIONALE:
For a demo/evaluation environment, fast startup is critical.
In production, system would run 24/7, naturally accumulating
all timeframes. The 1s timeframe provides MORE than enough
data to demonstrate all analytical capabilities.

After 1 hour of running:
- 1s: 13,600+ bars (10K historical + 3,600 live)
- 1m: 60 bars (all from live data)
- 5m: 12 bars (all from live data)
```

---

### 2. **On-Demand Analytics Computation**

**Decision**: Compute analytics when requested, don't persist to database

**Trade-offs**:
```
✅ PROS:
- Always fresh calculations
- No cache invalidation complexity
- Flexible parameter changes (window size, regression method)
- Less storage overhead
- Simpler codebase

❌ CONS:
- 2-3 second computation on app restart
- No historical analytics snapshots
- Recomputes every time

⚖️ RATIONALE:
With 10K bars, computation is fast (2-3 seconds). The ability
to instantly change parameters (window size: 20→50, regression
method: OLS→Ridge) without worrying about stale cached data
provides better UX. For production, would add persistent
analytics with TTL caching.
```

---

### 3. **SQLite vs Production Database**

**Decision**: Use SQLite for data storage

**Trade-offs**:
```
✅ PROS:
- Zero configuration (no server setup)
- Embedded (single file)
- Perfect for development/demo
- Fast for current data volume (<100K rows)
- Easy to inspect and debug

❌ CONS:
- Limited concurrency (write locks)
- Not suitable for production scale
- No built-in time-series optimizations
- Manual index management

⚖️ RATIONALE:
For evaluation purposes, SQLite is ideal. For production,
would migrate to:
- TimescaleDB (time-series optimized)
- PostgreSQL (robust ACID compliance)
- InfluxDB (specialized time-series)

Current setup handles demo perfectly while keeping
deployment trivial.
```

---

### 4. **In-Memory vs Redis Buffering**

**Decision**: Support both Redis and in-memory buffering with graceful fallback

**Trade-offs**:
```
✅ PROS:
- Works without Redis (easier setup)
- Automatic fallback (robust)
- Optional Redis for production

❌ CONS:
- In-memory buffer lost on crash
- Limited buffer capacity without Redis

⚖️ RATIONALE:
Prioritizes ease of evaluation. Users can run immediately
without installing Redis. In production, Redis would be
enabled for:
- Persistent buffering
- Distributed caching
- Multi-process coordination
```

---

### 5. **Logging Level Configuration**

**Decision**: Use INFO level logging by default

**Trade-offs**:
```
✅ PROS:
- Clean logs (not overwhelming)
- Important events visible
- Performance (less I/O)

❌ CONS:
- Resampling debug messages hidden
- Requires log level change for detailed debugging

⚖️ RATIONALE:
INFO level provides good visibility without noise.
Resampling happens every second - DEBUG logging would
create 1000s of lines/minute. For troubleshooting,
can easily enable:

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

Current setup balances observability with readability.
```

---

### 6. **Single-Machine Architecture**

**Decision**: Deploy as single-process application

**Trade-offs**:
```
✅ PROS:
- Simple deployment (one command)
- Easy to understand
- No distributed system complexity
- Perfect for development/demo

❌ CONS:
- Not horizontally scalable
- Single point of failure
- All components share resources

⚖️ RATIONALE:
For evaluation, simplicity > scalability. System demonstrates
all required functionality. Architecture is modular enough
to split into microservices when needed:

Potential production architecture:
┌──────────────┐
│   Frontend   │ (Streamlit or React)
└──────┬───────┘
       │
┌──────▼───────┐
│  API Gateway │ (FastAPI)
└──────┬───────┘
       │
┌──────┴───────┬────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Data Service │ Analytics  │ Alert       │
│ (WebSocket)  │ Service    │ Service     │
└──────────────┴────────────┴─────────────┘
       │            │              │
┌──────▼────────────▼──────────────▼───────┐
│       Message Queue (Kafka/RabbitMQ)      │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
       │
┌──────▼─────────┐
│  TimescaleDB   │
└────────────────┘
```

---

### 7. **Streamlit vs Custom Frontend**

**Decision**: Use Streamlit for UI

**Trade-offs**:
```
✅ PROS:
- Rapid development (hours not weeks)
- Built-in interactivity
- Python-native (no JS required)
- Auto-refresh support
- Perfect for internal tools

❌ CONS:
- Limited customization
- Not ideal for public-facing apps
- Performance limitations at scale
- Session state management quirks

⚖️ RATIONALE:
For a quant developer assignment, demonstrating analytical
capability > frontend polish. Streamlit enables focus on
statistics rather than CSS/JavaScript. For production
client-facing app, would use:
- React + FastAPI backend
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Professional design system
```

---

### 8. **Regression Method Defaults**

**Decision**: Default to OLS regression, offer Ridge/Lasso as options

**Trade-offs**:
```
✅ PROS:
- OLS: Fastest, most interpretable
- Ridge/Lasso: Handle overfitting
- User choice preserved

❌ CONS:
- OLS sensitive to outliers
- Ridge/Lasso require alpha tuning (currently fixed at 1.0)

⚖️ RATIONALE:
OLS is the standard for pair trading hedge ratios. Ridge
and Lasso included to demonstrate awareness of regularization.
For production, would implement:
- Cross-validation for alpha selection
- Huber regression (outlier robust)
- Kalman filter (dynamic hedge ratio)
```

---

### 9. **Fixed Window Sizes**

**Decision**: Single window size for all rolling calculations (default 20)

**Trade-offs**:
```
✅ PROS:
- Simple configuration
- Consistent analysis
- Easy to understand

❌ CONS:
- Z-score and correlation use same window
- May not be optimal for each metric
- No adaptive windows

⚖️ RATIONALE:
For evaluation, simplicity is key. In production, would use:
- Z-score window: 20-30 bars (mean reversion signals)
- Correlation window: 50-100 bars (relationship stability)
- ADF window: 50+ bars (statistical significance)

Current implementation allows changing via slider (10-100).
```

---

### 10. **Binance-Only Data Source**

**Decision**: Only support Binance Futures WebSocket

**Trade-offs**:
```
✅ PROS:
- Free, public data
- High-quality feed
- Low latency
- No authentication required

❌ CONS:
- Single exchange (execution risk)
- Crypto only (no equities/futures)
- Dependent on Binance uptime

⚖️ RATIONALE:
For demonstration, Binance is ideal. Architecture supports
multiple data sources through adapter pattern:

# In websocket_client.py
class DataSourceAdapter:
    def subscribe(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

class BinanceAdapter(DataSourceAdapter):
    def subscribe(self):
        # Binance implementation

class InteractiveBrokersAdapter(DataSourceAdapter):
    def subscribe(self):
        # IB implementation

Easy to extend when needed.
```

## 📊 Current System Status

### Data Processed (as of submission)
```
Ticks Ingested:        583,000+
OHLCV Bars Generated:  10,000+ (1s timeframe)
Time Period:           ~3 hours of live data
Symbols Monitored:     BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT
```


## 📈 Analytics Methodology

### Pair Trading Strategy
The system implements a **statistical arbitrage** approach:

1. **Identify Pair**: Select two correlated instruments (BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT)
2. **Estimate Hedge Ratio**: Use regression to find optimal ratio (β = -0.87)
3. **Construct Spread**: Create market-neutral position (ETH - β×BTC + α)
4. **Monitor Z-Score**: Track spread deviation from mean
5. **Generate Signals**: 
   - Z > 2: Spread overextended (potential short the spread)
   - Z < -2: Spread underextended (potential long the spread)
   - Z → 0: Mean reversion opportunity (close position)

### Statistical Validation
- **ADF Test**: Ensures spread is stationary (mean-reverting) - **PASSED** ✅
- **Correlation**: Monitors relationship strength (0.4119 = moderate)
- **R²**: Validates hedge ratio quality (0.0006 = low at 1s, normal for HFT)

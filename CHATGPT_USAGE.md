2. **Made Architectural Decisions**: Chose technologies and patterns
3. **Guided Implementation**: Provided context and direction
4. **Validated Code**: Reviewed AI-generated code for correctness
5. **Integration**: Ensured components work together
6. **Testing Strategy**: Defined testing approach
7. **Configuration**: Set appropriate parameters
8. **Quality Control**: Reviewed output quality

## Prompt Engineering Strategies

### Effective Prompts Used
1. **Context-Rich Prompts**: Provided assignment context and constraints
2. **Incremental Prompts**: Built system in logical chunks
3. **Specification Prompts**: Detailed requirements for each component
4. **Review Prompts**: Asked AI to review and improve code
5. **Documentation Prompts**: Requested comprehensive documentation

### Example Prompt Progression
```
1. "I have a quant developer assignment. Let me share the requirements."
2. "Design the overall architecture for this system."
3. "Now implement the WebSocket client component."
4. "Add error handling and reconnection logic."
5. "Create unit tests for the WebSocket client."
6. "Document the WebSocket client with usage examples."
```

## Limitations Acknowledged

### AI Limitations Encountered
1. **No Direct Testing**: AI cannot run/test code
2. **No Environment Access**: Cannot verify Redis/database setup
3. **Limited Domain Expertise**: Required human guidance on quant concepts
4. **Integration Challenges**: Human needed to ensure components integrate

### Human Intervention Required
1. Testing and debugging (would be required in real scenario)
2. Configuration tuning
3. Performance validation
4. Business logic validation

## Learning Outcomes

### For the Developer (Pranav)
1. **Accelerated Development**: 10x faster than solo implementation
2. **Best Practices Learned**: Discovered patterns from AI suggestions

3. **Prompt Engineering**: Effective AI collaboration
4. **Code Review**: Ability to evaluate generated code
5. **Integration**: Bringing components together
6. **Problem Solving**: Knowing what to ask and when

## Ethical Considerations

### Transparency
- Full disclosure of AI usage (this document)
- Honest about contribution percentages
- Clear about human decision-making role

### Academic Integrity
- Assignment explicitly encourages AI usage
- Focus is on design thinking, not just coding
- Demonstrates modern development practices

### Professional Context
- In real-world MFT firms, developers use all available tools
- AI assistance is becoming standard practice
- What matters is the end result and architectural soundness

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates:
1. **Effective AI Collaboration**: Leveraging AI for productivity

3. **Modern Development**: Using cutting-edge tools effectively
4. **Transparency**: Clear documentation of AI usage

The assignment's goal was to assess analytical reasoning, design ability, and clarity of communication. These qualities are demonstrated through:
- Sound architectural decisions (human)
- Clear documentation (AI-assisted, human-reviewed)
- Comprehensive implementation (AI-generated, human-guided)
- Thoughtful design philosophy (human)

**Final Note**: In a production environment, this code would require:
- Extensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Monitoring and alerting
- Production deployment considerations

The current implementation serves as a high-quality prototype demonstrating design thinking and implementation capability.
